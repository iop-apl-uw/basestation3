<p><a name="GLIDER_REBOOT">GLIDER_REBOOT<br>
A glider reboot has been detected be comparing the boot count as reported in the <code>comm.log</code> file for the last two call ins.
This may be an expected situation if the glider just turned on.  If this is not expected, a capture file may or may not be automatically
uploaded.  
</p>

<p><a name="NON_QUIT_RECOVERY">NON_QUIT_RECOVERY<br>
A non-quit recovery has been reported in the most recent <code>comm.log</code> session.  
</p>

<p><a name="AUXCOMPASS">AUXCOMPASS<br>
An auxcompass data file contains no <code>%pressure</code> slope/y-intercept metadata, so the pressure data cannot be corrected.  
</p>

<p><a name="BAD_AUXPRESSURE">BAD_AUXPRESSURE<br>
The mean of the auxPressure or auxCompass pressure data is less then 10.  This means the sensor has been misconfigured and the
pressure data will not be used.
</p>

<p><a name="BAD_DIVE_SPEC">BAD_DIVE_SPEC<br>
During processing of a directives file such as <code>sg_directives_suggestions.txt</code> or
<code>sg_directives.txt</code>, a bad dive specification was encountered.  <code>See Seaglider_Quality_Control_Manual.html</code>
in the docs directory for correct format.
</p>

<p><a name="CONVERSION_ISSUES">CONVERSION_ISSUES<br>
There were errors duirng the processing of listed files from the Seaglider.  There are a number of reasons why these issues arise, but most
common are not having all the file framgments uploaded, or that a file fragment was only partially uploaded.  For some cases, there will be
recommendations made on what to fix.
</p>

<p><a name="CONVERSION_TIMEOUT">CONVERSION_TIMEOUT<br>
A external conversion binary that the basestation runs to process data or eng files took too long to run and was stopped.  If this problem persists,
contact iopsg@uw.edu to troubleshoot.
</p>

<p><a name="DB_LOCKED">DB_LOCKED<br>
The sqlite mission database is locked and not updateable.  Once locked, the Seaglider's website will no longer update with new Seaglider data.
This is an internal basestation error and should be reported to iopsg@uw.edu if it occurs.
</p>

<p><a name="FILE_RETRY">FILE_RETRY<br>
One or more file fragments were uploaded multiple times in a single communications session.  This situation is an
internal error between the basestation and Seaglider and should be reported to iopsg@uw.edu.
</p>

<p><a name="FMS">FMS<br>
There are several possible Flight Model System (FMS) alerts that fall in this category:
<ul>
  <li>There are not enough different recent pitches for the FMS to constrain drag parameter.  You might consider a steeper pitched dive or two to help the solution</li>
  <li>The initial estimated vehicle drag larger than expected.  Generally, this may be ignored - especially if addition sensors installed since the last deployment.</li>
  <li>There has been a large increase in the estimated drag.  This can be something that is transient, but the drag estimates should be watched as this may indicate biofouling</li>
  <li>The FMS system will issue suggested updates for the Seaglider's on-board <code>$HD_A</code>, <code>$HD_B</code> and <code>$HD_C</code>.  Generally, if the values are
  considerably different from the on-board values, updating is a good idea.  Note that updating These suggestions only affect the Seaglider's on-board decisions about
  pitch and thrust - the FMS system continues to estimate the drag coefficients independently in order to generate an estimate of the Seaglider forward velocity.
</ul>
</p>

<p><a name="FM_GRID_SOLUTION">FM_GRID_SOLUTION<br>
One or more netcdf files are not included in the Flight Model System (FMS) solution.  This usually is from the netcdf file not containing enough
information for the FMS system.
</p>

<p><a name="FM_IGNORE">FM_IGNORE<br>
One or more variables related to turning the Seaglider hydrodynamic model were found in <code>sg_calib_constants.m</code> and are not
being used because the Flight Model System (FMS) is in use.  To supress this alert, remove, comment out, or add <code>% FM_ignore</code>
to the lines in sg_calib_constants.m.  If you do not want to run the FMS and tune the model yourself, then add <code>--ignore_flight_model</code>
to the command line in <code>glider_logout</code>
</p>

<p><a name="GPSROLLOVER">GPSROLLOVER<br>
The GPS in the Seaglider has not been upgraded to handle the latest GPS rollover event on April 6, 2019.
</p>

<p><a name="INCORRECT_CT">INCORRECT_CT<br>
RBR Legato CTD data was found, but the <code>sg_ct_type</code> varible in <code>sg_calib_contants.m</code> was not set to <code>4</code>.
</p>

<p><a name="LOGFILE_WARN">LOGFILE_WARN<br>
One or more <code>$WARN</code> lines was found in the Seaglider logfile.  These messages are important warning conditions the pilot
may need to take action on - consult the text for further details.
</p>

<p><a name="MAGCAL">MAGCAL<br>
There was an error processing the supplied compass calibration file.
</p>

<p><a name="MASS_MISMATCH">MASS_MISMATCH<br>
The specified mass in <code>sg_calib_constants.m</code> differs from what is on the Seaglider.  The value in  <code>sg_calib_constants.m</code> is what the basestation will use to process data.
</p>

<p><a name="MISSING_SEABIRD_CAL">MISSING_SEABIRD_CAL<br>
One or more of the needed calibration coefficients for the Seabird CTD were not found in the <code>sg_calib_consts.m</code> file.
</p>

<p><a name="MISSING_SEALEVEL">MISSING_SEALEVEL<br>
This alert can refer to one of two conditions.
<ul>
  <li>For a scicon based instrument, the alert indicates that an instrument
reporting pressure is missing the sealevel pressure reading.  For a RBR legato, a pressure of <code>10082.0</code> is assumed.
  For the truck sensor, no zero offset is assumed.  </li>
  <li>For a RBR Legato being sampled by the truck, the <code>legato_sealevel</code> variable was not specified in the
  <code>sg_calib_constants.m</code> file.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><a name="SBECT_COEFFICIENT">SBECT_COEFFICIENT<br>
One or more of the Seabird CTD calibration coefficients differs from what was specified in the <code>sg_calib_consts.m</code> file
and what was is on board the gliders parameters.
</p>

<p><a name="TIMEOUT">TIMEOUT<br>
An instrument reported timeouts during sampling.  For a serial based device, a few timeouts per dive may be
viewed as acceptable - more then that is a potential sign of a failing instrument.  For frequency base instruments
any timeouts are potential sign of instrument failure.
