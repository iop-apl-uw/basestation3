# Basetation extensions that are to be run during glider processing are listed here.
#
# .extension files are searched for in the following locations and processed in order.
# 
#    /usr/local/basestation3/etc/.extensions
#    {group_etc}/.extensions (if --group_etc is specified on the Base.py command line)
#    {seaglider_hom_ directory}/.extensions
#
# Extensions themselves searched for in the following locations
#
#    For /usr/local/basestation3/etc/.extensions:
#    - /usr/local/basestation3
#
#    For {group_etc}/.extensions (if --group_etc is specified on the Base.py command line)
#    - /usr/local/basestation3
#    - {group_etc}
#
#    For {seaglider_hom_ directory}/.extensions
#    - /usr/local/basestation3
#    - {seaglider_hom_ directory}
#
# Extension are processed at specific points during basestation processing - each point
# corresponds to a section (furhter documented below) - extension listed in that section will
# be processed. Extensions outside a section are consider to be in section [mission].
#
# Hash symbol marks a comment line
# 
# Note: a extension may include a leading path that is relative the search location.  For
# example, if /usr/local/basestation3/etc/.extension contained the following line:
#
# local/MyExtension.py
#
# The extension would be looked for in /usr/local/basestation3/local/MyExtension.py
#
#
[dive]
# Extensions listed in this section are run after all dive files have been processed
# (include netcdf creation) and before whole mission processing has occured.
#
# Uncomment to enable KKYY file creation
# KKYY.py
#
# Uncomment for simplified netcdf files
# SimpleNetCDF.py
#
# Uncomment for creation of files for submission to the gliderdac
# Note - additional configuraiton required - see gliderdac.md in the docs/gliderdac directory
# GliderDAC.py
#
# Uncomment for creation of glider position text file (time, lat lon)
# MakePositions.py
#
# Support for plotting compress TS profiles
# MakePlotTSProfile.py
#
# A simple/sample extension - starting point for writing a new extension
# SimpleExtension.py
#
[missionearly]
# Extensions listed in this section are run after whole mission processing has occured, but
# before the whole mission plots are generated
[mission]
# Extensions listed in this section are run after whole mission processing has occured and
# whole mission plots have been generated
[postnetcdf]
# Extensions listed in this section are run immediately after a per-dive netcdf file has been created,
# to allow for additional science processing.  The extension is invoked once for each file.
#
# A extension to add additional columns with a manually adjusted temperature and/or salinity.
# A good starting point for writing an expanded package of post-basestaiton processing.
#CTDAdjustment.py
#
[prelogin]
# Extensions listed in this section are run before the glider has finished logging in.
# NOTE: Any extensions run here will be blocking the glider's login, so they should be brief
# This secion replaces the .pre_extensions file
[commloggps]
# Extensions listed in this section are run after the counter/gps line has arrived in the comm.log
# for the current glider callin
