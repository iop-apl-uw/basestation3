## .sftp file
#
# This file controls the sending of data products created during basestation
# processing via sftp (secure file transfer protocol to an openssh server).
#
# A global copy of this file may be place in
#
# /usr/local/basestation3/etc/.sftp
#
# If --group_etc is specified on the Base.py command line, then a that directory will
# also be searched for a version of this file
#
# Each line of this file is of the format
# # Lines are of the form
# host,user,pwd,path_to_key,port,remote_path[,[eng| log| pro| bpo| csv| asc| cap| comm| dn_kkyy| up_kkyy| nc| mission_ts| mission_pro]+] | ,all
# where:
# hose - host name or address for sftp server
# user - user name on the sftp server
# password - password on the sftp server - leave empty for none
# path_to_key - path to the keyfile. Note: this file is very permission sensitive
# path_to_known_hosts - path to the known_hosts_file (if needed). Note: this file is very permission sensitive
# port - optional override to port on the host - leave empty for default of 22
# remote_path - path to the place the products in (must be / at a minimum)
#
# The known_hosts file must have been pre-populated with the servers fingerprints.  This can be done by
# connecting to server via sftp as the user or by running ssh-keyscan -H myserver >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts (under the appropriate user account).
#
# eng, log, pro, bpo, csv, asc, cap , dn_kkyy, up_kkyy, nc - send any newly created files of the specified extension
# comm - send the comm.log file
# mission_ts, mission_pro - send the mission timeseries or mission profile, if they have been updated on the processing
# all - send all the newly created or updated files
# fnmatch_**** - uses Unix shell-style wildcard **** to match any created/or updated file
# file_**** - uses Unix shell-style wildcard to match any file in the mission directory, regardless of when it was created
#
## Examples
#
## Push out the typical per-dive files to the incoming directory on a remote server
#myserver.org,sg000,,/home/sg000/.ssh/my_private_key,,,incoming,log,eng,cap,nc,comm
